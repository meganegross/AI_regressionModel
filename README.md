# AI_regressionModel
<p>The purpose of this project is to build a regression model to predict the body fat percentage of males given data such as body density, weight, height, and more measurements. The technique used to solve this problem was a feedforward neural network with 4 layers (3 hidden layers) with a rectified linear unit activation function. 
The methods used to evaluate the model (R2, mean absolute error, and mean squared error) found the model to be moderate to weak in efficiency and prediction. The average absolute error was 3.3 meaning with any prediction given it could be about three units higher or lower than the actual value. 
While this model still has some area of usefulness, in reference to the output being predicted (body fat percentage) the area of error is too high to be used in real life situations. It is with this in mind that this model be further worked on to increase the accuracy.
